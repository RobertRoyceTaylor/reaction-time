## General Information

SpotOn - A Reaction Based Game was created as a project to practice working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The idea was based upon the game [Aim Lab](https://store.steampowered.com/app/714010/Aim_Lab/) with the idea being instead of improving your aim for games such as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Valorant, or Apex Legends, you can improve your speed and accuracy on a mobile phone or general usage with a mouse / touchscreen.  


## Instructions

SpotOn - A Reaction Based Game is very easy and intuitive to start. Once the page loads all you need to do is press the SPACE key (desktop version) or click within the play area to start.

## Mobile vs. Computer

One of the goals with this project was scalability. No matter what size screen the user is playing on, be it a 3840 x 2160 pixel 4K television or a 640 x 1136 pixel iPhone SE, the app will work.

Desktop View (1920 x 1080 Monitor)
